    "### Targeted Problems \n",
    "1. Anyone who wants to relocate to a new city. The crime rate of that city must be analysed. This project does exactly that, Crime Rate of all Boroughs of NYC will be analysed and the Borough with Least Crime Rate will be suggested to the user.\n",
    "2. Real Estate Price is one of the most important things to look for while relocating. Everyone wants a good place to settle which is in a good neighborhood but not very expensive. This project will give the Most and Least Expensive neighborhoods of Staten Island.\n",
    "3. All parents wants their children to get good education. This project suggests users the schools in every neighborhood in Staten Island and also School types, Level etc.\n",
    "4. Hospital are an overlooked point while moving to a new Location. This project will give the informations about nearby Hospitals, their overall Rating and many Features.\n",
    "5. Last but not least, this porject will provide an analysis of Most Visited venues like Restaurants, Grocery Shops, Hospitals, Malls Rating etc in every Neighborhood of Staten Island so relocators know beforehand which venues they value the most so it will become easier for them to settle."
